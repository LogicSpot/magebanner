#MageBanner by [LogicSpot]

MageBanner is a simple module for [Magento] that makes it really easy for you to setup and manage banners and banner groups (or sliders).

It also aims to be as user friendly and developer friendly as possible. Making it really easy to add new banners (and banner groups) wherever you want on the site, and it is compatible with any JS slider library you want through a very simple theme update.

The aim of this module is to give you increadably granular control in terms of when to show a your banners, how to show them, and where to show them.

##Features

Below are some features that we feel are unique (or at least done better) in this module.
- Complete control over banners and banner groups
- Date __and__ time setting __per__ banner
- Automatically generated code for including by XML or CMS
- Widgets for including individual banners or banner groups directly in CMS pages or blocks
- Options to sort by user defined priority or randomly
